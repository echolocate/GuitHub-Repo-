                <p>Pristine condition, and comes with the silver
                    Rickenbacker case, certificate and warranty card.<br>
                    This is a beautiful guitar, but was somewhat of an impulse buy as
                    the previous owner didn't play it and certainly never paid for it.<br>
                    Needs to find a home.</p>

                <p>Branded as a Fender Player Stratocaster in a Tidepool finish.
                    Excellent condition, pickups recently upgraded, plays beautifully.
                    Previous owner only had about 5 months left on the repayments until
                    Covid happened. Oh well. Grab this deal now and own a piece of history.</p>

                <p>Good condition Les Paul. No chips in the finish, only minor
                    scrathes as is to be expected. Electrics all working
                    as they should. These guitars really do sound great.
                    Just listen to it! Seized in a raid, the previous owner obviously
                    embraced the Rock n Roll lifestyle a bit too fully.</p>
